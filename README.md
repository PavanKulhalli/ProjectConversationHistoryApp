# README

Make sure you have Ruby installed. If you don't we recommend using [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/) or [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install and manage your Ruby installs. See their websites on instructions on how to install the latest version of Ruby.

### Get up & running

Running `bundle install` will install gems.
Running `rails db:migrate` will create database structure.

Running `rails db:seed` will create data.

Run the server using `rails s`

Congratulations, you have set up the Rails backend
